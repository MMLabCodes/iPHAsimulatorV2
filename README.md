iPHASimulator v2 is a notebook-driven Python toolkit for building, validating,
parameterising, simulating, preprocessing, and analysing polyhydroxyalkanoate
(PHA) oligomer systems.

The current v2 workflow focuses on reproducible PHA molecular simulation
preparation. It starts from chemically defined PHA oligomers, exports structure
files, prepares Amber/GAFF2 and GROMACS/OpenMM simulation inputs, supports HPC
execution patterns, and provides early analysis and PHA-enzyme docking
preparation notebooks.

This software has been developed by King's College London under the frame of SATISPHACTION project (https://satisphaction.eu/). 
SATISPHACTION is a 4-year project awarded in 2025 under the highly competitive EIC Pathfinder Challenge call “Nature-inspired alternatives for food packaging and films for agriculture”. 
It focuses on developing next-generation, fully biodegradable PHA-based materials for food packaging that replace fossil-based plastics and promote circular economy.

## Launch the GUI

From the repository root, launch the Streamlit interface with:

```bash
python -m streamlit run pha_gui.py
```

## What It Does

iPHASimulator v2 currently provides:

- RDKit-based PHA oligomer generation for curated common PHAs and custom
  3-hydroxy acid monomers.
- Validation and visualisation of generated oligomer structures.
- PDB and SDF export for downstream molecular simulation workflows.
- AmberTools/GAFF2 parameterisation for PHA oligomers.
- OpenMM and GROMACS workflow preparation for dry and solvated systems.
- HPC workflow helpers for repeatable simulation execution.
- GROMACS trajectory preprocessing for analysis-ready trajectories.
- Basic polymer trajectory analysis.
- Residue-to-PHA minimum-distance heatmaps and sampled contact occupancies for
  existing enzyme–PHA trajectories; see [the contact workflow](docs/enzyme_contacts.md).
- PHA-enzyme docking input preparation for manual HADDOCK workflows.

DFT workflows are not documented as a current v2 capability.

## Workflow Overview

![iPHASimulator v2 workflow: PHA design and validation, GAFF2 and CGenFF parameterisation, simulation and HPC execution, polymer and enzyme–PHA analysis, and planned database and machine-learning extensions.](docs/_static/images/iphasimulator-v2-workflow.png)

Numbered boxes correspond to the tutorial notebooks; dashed outlines indicate
optional routes or planned extensions. See the [notebook catalogue](docs/notebooks.md)
for prerequisites and run order.

```text
Design -> validation -> structure export -> parameterisation -> MD simulation
       -> trajectory preprocessing -> analysis -> PHA-enzyme docking
```

The repository is organised around guided notebooks. Reusable code lives in
`src/iphasimulator`; notebooks should remain workflow tutorials rather than the
home of core package logic.

## Naming Convention

iPHASimulator uses one central naming convention for PHA identifiers:

| Meaning | Examples |
|---|---|
| Monomer / residue code | `3HB`, `3HO`, `3HDD` |
| Polymer code | `P3HB`, `P3HO`, `P3HDD` |
| Single oligomer chain with n repeat units | `P3HB_4`, `P3HO_8`, `P3HDD_4` |
| Multi-chain system | `25_P3HB_3`, `10_P3HO_8` |
| Head/main/tail residue database entries | `3HB_H`, `3HB_M`, `3HB_T` |

Use `src/iphasimulator/naming.py` to generate and validate names instead of
typing names manually in notebooks or scripts.

## Current Status

| Area | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Polymer generation | Working | Curated PHA names, side-chain based generation, and custom monomers are implemented in `src/iphasimulator`. |
| GAFF2/Amber parameterisation | Working | AmberTools workflow writes GAFF2 `mol2`, `frcmod`, `prmtop`, `inpcrd`, logs, and timing files. |
| CHARMM/CGenFF parameterisation | Manual website workflow + checks | `05B` checks CGenFF topology, penalties and stereochemistry; `06B` prepares and validates the Solution Builder package. Both use the packaged example by default. |
| GROMACS/OpenMM MD workflows | Working/in progress | Dry OpenMM and GROMACS preparation are working; solvated workflows and production-style routes are under active development by notebook. |
| HPC workflow | Working | YAML/SLURM-oriented helpers and notebook guidance are present for staged runs. |
| Polymer analysis | Working | Basic analysis notebook supports analysis from preprocessed trajectories. |
| PHA-enzyme docking preparation | Working/in progress | Notebook `11` prepares docking-ready polymer PDB inputs and manual HADDOCK job notes; docking submission is manual. |
| Enzyme-polymer MD | Planned | Docked complexes are not yet converted into enzyme-polymer MD systems. |
| ML/database functionality | Planned | Reusable databases and ML-backed workflows are future work. |

## Installation

iPHASimulator v2 is installed from the GitHub repository:
[MMLabCodes/iPHAsimulatorV2](https://github.com/MMLabCodes/iPHAsimulatorV2).

These instructions assume you are using a terminal on Linux, macOS, or Windows
with WSL. The terminal is the application where you type commands such as
`conda activate ...` and `python ...`.

### 1. Install Conda

Install Miniconda or Anaconda first if `conda` is not already available on your
computer. Conda is not normally installed with `pip`; it is a separate Python
and software environment manager. Conda creates an isolated environment, so the
packages for iPHASimulator v2 do not interfere with other Python projects.

Recommended options:

- **Miniconda**: smaller download, recommended if you only want the package
  manager and will install packages as needed.
- **Anaconda**: larger download, includes many scientific Python packages by
  default.

For most users, Miniconda is enough:

1. Open the Miniconda download page:
   <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>
2. Download the installer for your operating system.
3. Run the installer and accept the default options unless your institution has
   specific instructions.
4. Close and reopen the terminal after installation.

On Windows, this project is easiest to use through WSL because AmberTools and
many MD tools are Linux-oriented. Install Miniconda inside the WSL terminal, not
only in the normal Windows command prompt.

After installing Conda, open a new terminal and check that it works:

```bash
conda --version
```

### 2. Download iPHASimulator v2

The easiest way to download the repository is with `git`. First check whether
`git` is installed:

```bash
git --version
```

If that command is not found, install Git. If Conda is working, one simple route
is:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge git
```

If Conda asks `Proceed ([y]/n)?`, type `y` and press Enter.

Choose a folder where you keep research software, then download the repository
from GitHub:

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/MMLabCodes/iPHAsimulatorV2.git
cd iPHAsimulatorV2
```

If you do not use `git`, open the GitHub page in a browser, click **Code**,
choose **Download ZIP**, unzip the folder, and then open a terminal inside the
unzipped folder. The folder may be named `iPHAsimulatorV2` or
`iPHAsimulatorV2-main`, depending on how it was downloaded

### 3. Create and Activate the Environment

Create a new conda environment with Python 3.11:

```bash
conda create -n iphasimulator_v2 python=3.11
conda activate iphasimulator_v2
```

If conda asks `Proceed ([y]/n)?`, type `y` and press Enter.

When the environment is active, your terminal prompt should usually start with
`(iphasimulator_v2)`.

### 4. Install the Python Package

The Python dependencies are declared in `pyproject.toml`. You do not need to
type every Python package name manually. From the repository root, run:

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[dev,md,gui]"
```

This command tells `pip` to read `pyproject.toml` and install:

- the core `iphasimulator` package;
- the main Python dependencies such as RDKit, numpy, pandas, scipy, networkx,
  and pyyaml;
- the `dev` tools, including pytest and JupyterLab;
- the `md` tools, including OpenMM, ParmEd, and MDTraj;
- the `gui` tools, including Streamlit for the graphical interface.

The `-e` option means "editable install". This is useful for development because
changes made in `src/iphasimulator/` are used immediately without reinstalling
the package.

### 5. Check the Python Installation

Run these commands from the same activated environment:

```bash
python -c "import iphasimulator; print('iPHASimulator import OK')"
python -c "from rdkit import Chem; import openmm; import parmed; import mdtraj; import streamlit; print('Python dependencies OK')"
```

### 6. Start the Graphical Interface

The graphical interface is provided by `pha_gui.py` and requires Streamlit.
Streamlit is installed automatically when you use the
`python -m pip install -e ".[dev,md,gui]"` command above.

Activate the same Conda environment, move to the repository root, and start the
interface with:

```bash
conda activate iphasimulator_v2
python -m streamlit run pha_gui.py
```

Use `python -m streamlit run pha_gui.py`, not `python pha_gui.py`. Streamlit must
start its web server before the interface can work. Your web browser should open
automatically, normally at <http://localhost:8501>. Press `Ctrl+C` in the
terminal when you want to stop the server.

If Python reports `No module named 'streamlit'`, confirm that the correct Conda
environment is active and install the GUI dependencies again:

```bash
conda activate iphasimulator_v2
python -m pip install -e ".[gui]"
```

### 7. Check External Simulation Tools

Some notebooks call external command-line programs. These are not ordinary
Python imports, so they may need to be installed separately in the same conda
environment:

- AmberTools for GAFF2 parameterisation (`antechamber`, `parmchk2`, `tleap`);
- GROMACS for GROMACS MD workflows (`gmx`);
- Open Babel for optional structure conversion (`obabel`).

Check whether they are available:

```bash
which antechamber
which tleap
which gmx
which obabel
gmx --version
obabel -V
```

If any command is missing, install that external tool before running the
notebooks that require it. For example, AmberTools, GROMACS, and Open Babel are
available from conda-forge:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge ambertools gromacs openbabel
```

After installing them, check again:

```bash
which antechamber
which tleap
which gmx
which obabel
gmx --version
obabel -V
```

### 8. Merge Restarted GROMACS Outputs

Long GROMACS simulations may produce several trajectory (`.xtc`) and energy
(`.edr`) files after restarts. The merge module discovers the initial
`step7_production` files, the optional unnumbered `step8_production_2us` files,
and numbered continuation files such as `part0002` and `part0003`.

The module can be run directly inside the directory containing the XTC and EDR
files. First change into that directory and perform a dry run:

```bash
cd /path/to/system_directory
python -m iphasimulator.trajectory_gromacs_merge --dry-run
```

The dry run prints the numerically ordered input files and planned commands but
does not run GROMACS. Review that list carefully. To perform both trajectory and
energy merging, run:

```bash
python -m iphasimulator.trajectory_gromacs_merge
```

Alternatively, pass the simulation directory while working elsewhere:

```bash
python -m iphasimulator.trajectory_gromacs_merge /path/to/system_directory
```

The trajectory filename records the highest continuation part included. For
example, if `part0003` is the highest discovered XTC part, the outputs are:

```text
production_combined_003.xtc
production_combined_003.edr
```

Both output suffixes record the highest part included in their respective merge.
The suffix is numeric: `part0009` produces `_009.xtc` or `_009.edr`, and
`part0010` produces `_010.xtc` or `_010.edr`. An unnumbered
`step8_production_2us` file is treated as continuation 1; a step-7-only output
uses `_000`.

The module runs `gmx check` on every input and validates the final outputs. It
preserves the original files, does not infer times from filenames, and does not
use `-settime`. Existing combined outputs are protected by default.

Optional flags:

```text
--trajectory-only   Merge only XTC files.
--energy-only       Merge only EDR files.
--skip-check        Skip input and output gmx check validation.
--overwrite         Allow replacement of existing combined outputs.
--dry-run           Print the planned commands without running GROMACS.
```

If continuation XTC files exist but continuation EDR files do not, the module
still merges the trajectory and clearly reports that energy merging was skipped.

### 9. Start the Notebooks

Then start the notebooks from the repository root:

```bash
jupyter lab notebooks/
```

Generated structures, parameter files, simulation inputs, trajectories, and logs
are written under `examples/output/`, which is ignored by Git.

## Testing the Installation

For the enzyme–PHA contact workflow, open
[`src/md_simulation_scripts/enzyme_contacts/enzyme_contacts.ipynb`](https://github.com/MMLabCodes/iPHAsimulatorV2/blob/main/src/md_simulation_scripts/enzyme_contacts/enzyme_contacts.ipynb)
or run `python src/md_simulation_scripts/enzyme_contacts/run_enzyme_contacts.py src/md_simulation_scripts/enzyme_contacts/GK13_P3HO_4.yaml`.
This defaults to a labelled preview. Add `--full` for every configured sampled
frame. Install the optional dependencies with `python -m pip install -e ".[analysis]"`
if needed. See [configuration, verified inputs and validation](docs/enzyme_contacts.md)
before interpreting results.

The main verification suite is in `tests/`. After installing the package, run the
tests from the repository root with `pytest`:

```bash
python -m pytest tests
```

Individual workflow areas can also be checked by running a specific test file:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_build_pha.py
python -m pytest tests/test_export.py
python -m pytest tests/test_md_workflow.py
python -m pytest tests/test_gromacs_runner.py
python -m pytest tests/test_trajectory_preprocessing.py
```

These tests cover the builder, monomer registry, stereochemistry, structure
export, GAFF2 workflow helpers, GROMACS conversion/preparation helpers, HPC
workflow helpers, and trajectory preprocessing utilities.

## Notebook Workflow

Read the execution cells before Run All: **05A currently enables GAFF2 parameterisation**,
and **10 runs preparation/solvation/minimisation and can submit with `sbatch`**.
06A, 06C and the quick dry check use default-off execution flags. 05B/06B
run their packaged input checks by default.

The notebooks are workflow modules, not a 01→12 sequence. Notebooks 01–04 build the PHA;
then pick **one** workflow; 07 explains HPC execution; choose the relevant analysis or docking module.

- PHA alone in water: 05A → 06A
- Enzyme–PHA in water (the method used for the project's research simulations): 05B → 06B
- Optional enzyme–PHA alternative with OpenMM: 05A → 06C

Outside the main workflows:

- Optional quick check of 05A parameters: 05A → 05A_quick_check_openmm (the GAFF2 files in
  OpenMM without water; not a physical result)

Both enzyme workflows need a docked enzyme–PHA complex PDB first; prepare the PHA input for
docking with `11_enzyme_docking_setup.ipynb`. 06B reproduces the project's research
simulations. 06C is a different force-field setup, so results are not directly comparable
with 06B. See [the full 06B–06C comparison](docs/workflows/optional_openmm.md)
for matched conditions, inputs, output formats and restart requirements.

## Minimal P3HB_4 Benchmark Workflow

`P3HB_4` is the default small benchmark system for checking the v2 workflow.

1. Install the environment and start Jupyter:

   ```bash
   conda activate iphasimulator_v2
   jupyter lab notebooks/
   ```

2. Run notebooks `01` to `04` using the P3HB tetramer target. The expected
   exported structure names are:

   ```text
   examples/output/polymer_structures/P3HB_4.sdf
   examples/output/polymer_structures/P3HB_4.pdb
   ```

3. Run `05A_amber_gaff2_parameters.ipynb` with `P3HB_4` as the target.
   The expected Amber/GAFF2 outputs are written under:

   ```text
   examples/output/md_tests/P3HB_4/gaff2/
   ```

4. Run the relevant MD notebook for the route being tested:

   - `06A_gaff2_gromacs_pha_in_water.ipynb` for the PHA in water with GROMACS (the polymer benchmark method).
   - Optional: `05A_quick_check_openmm.ipynb` for a fast OpenMM check of the GAFF2 files without water.

5. For production-style GROMACS trajectories, continue with:

   - `07_hpc_execution.ipynb` for local/HPC execution guidance.
   - `08_trajectory_preprocessing.ipynb` to generate analysis-ready trajectories.
   - `09_solvated_polymer_analysis.ipynb` for basic trajectory analysis.
   - `11_enzyme_docking_setup.ipynb` only after suitable production structures are available.
