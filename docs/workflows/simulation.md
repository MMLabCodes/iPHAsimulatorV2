# OpenMM and GROMACS preparation

Choose one engine route after [parameterisation](gaff2.md). The 06-series
notebooks are alternatives; you do not need to run all four in sequence.

```{warning}
The AMBER OpenMM runner, AMBER-to-GROMACS converter and GROMACS preparation module
currently have [import blockers](../capabilities.md#import-blockers). This page
describes their implemented interfaces and required handoffs. No simulation is
run during a documentation build.
```

## OpenMM: AMBER topology route

1. Obtain matching `P3HB_4.prmtop` and `P3HB_4.inpcrd` from the GAFF2 step.
2. Review notebook **06A** and choose a fresh output folder.
3. Start with a deliberately short run after the source and engine checks pass:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from iphasimulator.simulation_openmm_amber_runner import run_openmm_with_amber_topology

base = Path("examples/output/md_tests/P3HB_4")
outputs = run_openmm_with_amber_topology(
    base / "gaff2/P3HB_4.prmtop",
    base / "gaff2/P3HB_4.inpcrd",
    base / "openmm/dry_polymer",
    minimization_max_iterations=200,
    nvt_steps=100, npt_steps=100, production_steps=100,
    report_interval=10, platform_name="CPU",
)
```

That call executes minimisation and dynamics; it is not just a file writer.
The runner uses periodic handling when box vectors are present and records NPT
as skipped for nonperiodic input. Review stage logs, the final structure and
`openmm_summary.log` before increasing the run length. These short settings are
for a smoke test, not equilibration or convergence evidence.

**Native solvated OpenMM (06D) is a disabled template.** Its model construction
depends on a force field that covers both the PHA and water; it is not a finished
automatic solvation route.

## GROMACS: convert and prepare

1. In **06B**, use the converter/preparation helpers to convert AMBER parameters
   with ParmEd and create a self-contained dry run folder.
2. Validate topology includes, atom counts and the box relative to nonbonded
   cutoffs before any `grompp`/minimisation run.
3. In **06C**, generate the explicit-water/ion preparation scripts from the dry
   inputs. Review solvent group names and force-field/water compatibility.
4. Run the generated solvation script deliberately, then check coordinate and
   topology atom counts and solvent/ion molecule counts.
5. Carry the prepared folder to [HPC execution](hpc.md).

The standard folders are under `examples/output/md_tests/P3HB_4/gromacs/`, with
`dry_polymer/` and `solvated_polymer/` branches. The preparation module also
contains a CHARMM-GUI-style staged workflow; that is distinct from an automated
enzyme-complex builder. Solvation scripts reset intermediate files in their
target folder, so keep original inputs and use a dedicated workflow folder.
